Hi, I'm Dave.

I've done [10+ years](/history) in startups and scaleups, many as **CTO**.

I'm a glutton for punishment so I'm still in the startup world. I start startups, angel invest, and help founders and CTOs.

I get a lot of energy from helping founders so feel free to reach out, let's do coffee ☕️

**Examples** of what I've previously done to help:

* Interviewing potential CTOs or early-stage tech employees for non-technical founders.
* Being a trusted strategic voice for founders to run tech choices past.
* Helping founders assess the quality of an external tech build.
* Doing a tech and culture audit as a company starts to scale up.
* Balancing up tradeoffs for CTOs during early-stage build when money and time are short.
* Giving perspective on hiring so CTOs can avoid common pitfalls.
* Mentoring CTOs to improve their communication, management skills, and business understanding.
* Helping with org structure as the engineering/product team is growing.

<br/>

You don't have to get me in to help, though!

Founders starting tech companies have bunch of **common questions**. I've answered some of them here:

* What is the early-stage CTO role?
* Do I even need a CTO or can I outsource?
* What sort of background should I look for in a CTO?
* Is a fractional CTO a useful thing?
* What sort of tradeoffs should I expect to have to make?

If that hasn't answered your question - or maybe you prefer the personal touch! - feel free to hit me up on LinkedIn or wherever.
