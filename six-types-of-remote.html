      <h1>Six Levels of Difficulty for Remote</h1>
      <p>
        Remote is great for workers, but as a manager you have to think carefully about how hard you want to make it for your org.
      </p>
      <p>
        Levels of difficulty I've seen:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Not remote.</li>
        <li>Remote same city/location.</li>
        <li>Remote within a one hour flight.</li>
        <li>Remote in a similar timezone (3 hours or less).</li>
        <li>Remote in a barely overlapping timezone (4 hours to 8 hours).</li>
        <li>Remote in a non-overlapping timezone (more than 8 hours).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 1</strong> is the easiest for management. It's easy to communicate, to build culture, to assess performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 2</strong> is a bit harder. You need to be more intentional about communication and culture, and need to have a better idea of how you assess people. It helps to have weekly/bi-weekly office days.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 3</strong> is harder again. Now you can't have such regular office days - maybe once every couple of months, depending how many team members we're talking about. So everything requires more effort and intention.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 4</strong> gets harder again. You probably can't have many regular office days at all. Comms isn't necessarily much harder because mostly people are online at the same times. But culture can start to become a real problem because people need more help seeing each other as humans rather than disembodied names on a screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 5</strong> takes it up a big notch. Meetings start to be squashed in to the start/end of people's days when the rest of the team is actually online. All hands meetings become quite tricky - as the spread increases you probably can't find a time inside everyone's work hours. Individuals become more unattached from teammates and this requires effort to counter. It starts to be really hard to tell if someone's pulling their weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 6</strong> is really hard. Teammates can never find a time when they're both awake to sort out a small misunderstanding, and instead often resort to escalating asynchronous diatribes. People feel completely disconnected from "head office", leading to an us-vs-them mentality. All hands meetings start getting recorded (which means no-one watches them)  or held multiple times (which means it's not a conversation at all). Despite this, people still need to attend meetings outside their normal work hours, which drains their energy and motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some companies make Level 6 work, it's not impossible. But it takes a lot of skill in direction setting and true delegating to allow autonomy, and a lot of effort in keeping people feeling like one team.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you try that, make sure you know that it's going to be hard. Otherwise, try to stick to the lower levels and master those before you level up your org.
