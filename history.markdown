I'm a startup lifer, I've operated and founded and run a bunch of different startups over the last 15+ years.

This goes through that history in nauseating detail; congrats if you get through to the end.

I started coding with Applesoft BASIC on my late 80s Apple IIe (green screen!). That was a long time ago.

Since then I've coded professionally in many, many languages and frameworks:

    C/C++, Java, Fortran, Haskell, PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Elm, Bash, Terraform, React, React Native, Vue, Objective C, Swift, etc etc etc

And I've built infra, operated big platforms, designed databases, architected data pipelines, integrated third-party libraries, designed user interfaces, done user research, hired and managed many many people.

My first startup was **[Flippa](https://flippa.com/)**, the web's biggest *marketplace* for buying and selling websites. I was lucky to be given the role of Founding GM, and ran it from when it was nothing to much bigger (millions in revenue, 20+ staff across 4 countries). I started focusing on product and engineering, but over the life of it I ran marketing and customer support as well, and it was my business strategy, reporting directly the board.

Then I ran **[SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/)**, a *content* business in the same group which taught millions of people about web development. We moved from being a print book publisher to an advertising- and subscription-driven business, almost doubling advertising revenue in a year. I did all the same things again, but also now I was managing a sales team, which was a new interesting learning.

Around this time I also did **half an MBA** at Melbourne Business School. I got a bit bored after the first part but it was fascinating to learn the principles of financial management, marketing, process management, people management, other things.

Also I was CTO of the **SitePoint Group** for a while, which was making sure that across the whole group of companies (the two above and a couple of others) we were doing a good job of engineering, working closely with the engineering leads on org structure, people management, and tech choices.

Then I joined **Versent**, a consulting company, as a very early employee and created **[Stax](https://www.stax.io/)**, an AWS cloud management platform (B2B SaaS). We were building this in parallel with the growth of the professional services firm, and took it to a million ARR in a year or so. I was the GM in charge of it, so similar to Flippa I formulated the strategy, built out the product and the engineering team around it, and did a bunch of the go-to-market myself (sales, CPC campaigns).

More recently I co-founded **[Steppen](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/steppen-genz-health-fitness/id1568032711)** as CTO, a fitness app helping Gen Z women build healthy fitness habits. I built this out from scratch, hiring an engineering team, and scaling the app to hundreds of thousands of users. We raised money from some great investors but ultimately couldn't make it as big as we wanted - fitness is a hard space. We got a successful exit, selling Steppen to Alta.

So I still code a lot, I wrote almost all the code for Steppen, learning React Native and mobile app development quickly from zero knowledge.

But I'm also extremely comfortable hiring people, managing people and building high-peforming cultures, making tech choices, managing operations and tradeoffs.

And I have breadth across product, marketing, customer support, sales, business strategy.

The main reason I love the startup space is because I can use this whole varied skillset.
