I'm a startup lifer, I've operated and founded and run a bunch of different startups over the last 15+ years.

I've been coding since Applesoft BASIC on my late 80s Apple IIe (green screen!), and professionally since the early 2000s.

    C/C++, Java, Fortran (!), Haskell, PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Elm, Bash, Terraform, etc etc etc

My vague plan was to be a dev forever, but then I discovered startups and realised that great code comes from understanding the context - especially in **early-stage**.

This requires two things that don't always come naturally to engineers.

First you need to understand the **business**, what drives it and what's less important right now. This isn't easy but 

which requires lots of **communication**. This doesn't always come naturally to engineers, but I'm good at it, so I've spent a lot of time helping others with it.

I still code a lot, but also run teams and companies which have high-performing cultures.

My first startup was [Flippa](https://flippa.com/), the web's biggest *marketplace* for buying and selling websites. I was lucky to be given the role of Founding GM, and ran it from when it was nothing to much bigger (millions in revenue, 20+ staff across 4 countries).

Then I ran [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/), a *content* business in the same group which taught millions of people about web development. We moved from being a print book publisher to an advertising- and subscription-driven business, almost doubling advertising revenue in a year.
